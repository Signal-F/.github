## Welcome to the SignalF project
SignalF is a configurable, modular .NET measurement and control software specially designed for operation on single-board computers such as the Rasparry Pi or the Orange Pi.
In industry, single-board computers are primarily used in measurement and control technology (MCR), where they often replace the much more expensive programmable logic controllers (PLCs).
